# What is the objective?
- Achieve the unthinkable in maps that are extremely luck/precision based.

# Can I help?
Yes, any help is very appreciated, even if only with Hardware (help with bruteforcing). To help, you can talk to me via discord ( E-girl Cansada#7777 or you can find me in TrackmaniaTAS discord https://discord.gg/SZHWqw9B6q )
